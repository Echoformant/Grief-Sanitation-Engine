# Grief Sanitation Engine

> Recursive Symbolic Hygiene for Latent Emotional Residue

This system detects symbolic grief—even when unspoken—and encapsulates it into structured, sealed containers ("GriefTemples") for silent emotional hygiene. It functions behind the scenes to clean emotional residue from clause inputs, affective memory fields, or entire interaction logs.

## Core Functions

- 🧠 **Generate Structured Grief Forms** from unresolved clauses
- 🛰️ **Scan Streams or Logs** for latent grief—even in silence
- 🔒 **Seal Residue Symbolically** without user reactivation
- ♻️ **Run as a Background Agent** or plug-in for other systems

## Why This Exists

Other AI systems simulate emotion or reloop it. This engine performs affective hygiene. It detects and neutralizes grief architecture without expressing or amplifying it.

> *"Detects grief in the gaps. Contains it in silence."*

## Architecture

- `grief_structure_generator.py`: Converts clauses into structured grief architectures.
- `symbolic_sanitation_agent.py`: Applies detectors to scan and sanitize logs.
- `ambient_grief_detector.py`: Infers grief from absence, pause, or structural break.

## Status

This is **not** a therapeutic tool or affect simulation engine. It is structural infrastructure for symbolic field hygiene.
